This project is intended to be a humorous parody of [Hacker News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_News). It is not in any way affiliated with Hacker News. The page's theme and layout are based on the original site. The usernames are intended to be fictitious, as are the headlines. This site was made with [Faker.js](https://fakerjs.dev/) (The original version), [String.js](https://github.com/jprichardson/string.js/), and an old jQuery templating plugin written by John Resig in 2010.

None of the headlines are real and are programatically generated and totally random. The comments page is a shamless rip of a [Hackernews Parody Page](https://archive.ph/YkBtG) by Brad Conte. I apologize if any (fictitious) headlines may have offended you. Sometimes it might be off color, but that's not me, it's the Faker.js script at its worst.

This project was inspired by [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) and other [similar 'Does Not Exist' projects](https://thisxdoesnotexist.com/).

(Thank you Github for allowing me to host my project here).
